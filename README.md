# alphabetTableView

Tap the letters of the alphabet to jump from section to section to easily find the content you are looking for. 
Helpful for TableViews with a large amount of data. 

- Currently main functionality added. 

- I will be adding more features soon:
    - Add a custom color to the selected letter. 
    - UI Constraints for iPhone 5/SE
    - Dynamically change the content on the alphabet. For example, show an image instead of a letter.
    - And more...
